                <b>msg Local AI: Chat</b> is an application to locally run
                Large Language Model (LLM) based generative Artificial
                Intelligence (AI) characters (aka "chat-bots").
                <p/>
                It is based on the freely available <a href="https://faraday.dev">Faraday</a> LLM
                host application, four pre-installed Open Source
                <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/">Mistral 7B</a> LLMs, and 24
                pre-configured Faraday AI characters.
                <p/>
                Each Faraday AI character is a
                combination of a pre-selected LLM (fine-tuned for instruct or chat use),
                pre-configured LLM parameters, and a corresponding pre-selected LLM.

                <b>msg Local AI: Chat</b> ships as a setup program for the <i>Windows</i>
                operation system which installs the <i>Faraday</i> LLM host application, the
                <i>Mistral 7B</i> LLMs and pre-configures <i>Faraday</i> for the provided AI characters.

                The <b>msg Local AI: Chat</b> setup program does not require any
                administrator privileges during installation. Everything is installed
                into <tt>%localappdata%</tt> and <tt>%appdata%</tt> only. A simple
                click on the desktop icon "Uninstall msg Local AI Chat" will
                also uninstall it at any time again.

                <b>Notice on STATISTICS</b>: <b>msg Local AI: Chat</b> uses the <i>Faraday</i> LLM host
                application. <i>Faraday</i> sends anonymous usage information to its vendor.
                <i>msg Research</i> explicitly checked this communication in 2024/02 and
                considers it harmless from a GDPR point of view, as no personal
                information were contained in the sent data.
                <p/>
                <b>Notice on CLOUD</b>: <b>msg Local AI: Chat</b> uses the <i>Faraday</i> LLM host
                application. <i>Faraday</i> provides the possibility to create an account in
                the Cloud on <tt>faraday.dev</tt>, login to it from within the application,
                and use this account to upload and share chats and AI characters via
                the Cloud. For the intended use of <b>msg Local AI: Chat</b> none of this is
                functionality required or even recommended. The user is in charge when
                using this additional functionality of <i>Faraday</i>.
                <p/>
                <b>Notice on CONTENT</b>: <b>msg Local AI: Chat</b> uses <i>uncensored</i> LLMs which were
                trained by <i>Mistral AI</i> with huge amounts of unknown, publicly available
                data from the Internet. Hence the AI characters responses contain all
                type of public information and in an entirely <i>unfiltered</i> format. The
                user is responsible to treat the responses with care and especially
                always consider and evaluate the responses in the context of the current
                law and current social morality.
                <p/>
                <b>Notice on QUALITY</b>: <b>msg Local AI: Chat</b> is based on the decent but rather
                small Open-Source LLM <i>Mistral 7B</i> in order to run even on computers
                with very constrained RAM and CPU resources. As a consequence, the
                overall response quality obviously is noticeably reduced in contrast
                to state-of-the-art chat-bots, like the commercial <i>GPT-3.5/GPT-4</i> based
                <i>OpenAI ChatGPT</i>.

                <b>msg Local AI: Chat</b> is intended both as a learning application for
                Generative AI Prompt Engineering and as a production application for
                leveraging from generic text-based generative AI use-cases under full
                offline-first and GDPR-compliance aspects.
                <p/>
                During installation the installer will download between 4GB and 16GB
                of LLM data from the <i>HuggingFace</i> portal, depending on the particular
                features you selected during installation.
                <p/>
                <b>NOTICE</b>: Please be patient, the download will require many minutes, depending
                on how Internet connectivity. In case it breaks because of timeouts, just
                repeat the step.

                After installation, you find an icon named "msg Local AI Chat" on your
                desktop to run the <i>Faraday</i> LLM host application. After a short opt-in
                dialog of the <i>Faraday</i> vendor, you can select the particular
                AI character.
                <p/>
                You have 24 pre-defined AI characters available.
                Each AI character has a name based on its use-case and the language
                is speaks below its name. Click on the AI character to open a dialog
                with it.

                All AI characters not tagged with "GP" (general purpose) are
                instruct-based and primed to a particular use-case through
                a pre-configured system prompt (which can be found on the right
                sidebar under "Scenario").
                <p/>
                Do not chat with those
                instruct-based AI characters by asking questions. Instead,
                enter the request directly. For instance, for the <i>Translator (EN-DE)</i>
                AI character, directly enter your English text to be translated to
                German.
                <p/>
                Only the two "GP" (general purpose) AI characters named
                "Assistant" are chat-based and hence accept full question/answer
                dialog sessions. But beware of the above notice: Mistral 7B is
                an excellent small LLM, but cannot fully compete with ChatCPT, of course!
                <p/>
                <b>NOTICE</b>: just be patient on your initial request after
                entering an AI character, as the underlying
                LLM first has to be loaded into memory by <i>Faraday</i>.
